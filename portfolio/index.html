                                    <p>
                                        Site is underdone because of my having lost desire to keep on working on it. I have done necessary markup and have added styles. All i needed was to 
                                        add content in order to it would not look like empty page. That process took too much time which I could spent in learning something new.
                                        I followed right in that way. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        It was about September, 2019 when I actually had been starting to learn web-programming. Idea of creating site, as you can see above,
                                        came to my mind when I had been on my English course lesson. That day we should learn new theme and while I was taking notes of it, the idea of
                                        making internet project to lean English for free and everybody. Then I already knew how it would look on the site.  
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Technical part</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        That projects was written by me useing basic skills in HTML5 and CSS3. It took me about mounth to learn them. Then I even didnt know how to
                                        hide element and show it when its required, thus I had to seek out a solution. Euidently that it was simple JavaScript that scared me.
                                    </p>
